Task: Embedded C Programming for PIC18F4550 - Control Relays with Digital Input
Switches

Objective:
Develop a simple embedded C program for the PIC18F4550 microcontroller. The program
should control two relays based on the state of two digital input switches.

Materials:
- PIC18F4550 Microcontroller
- Two Digital Input Switches
- Two Relays (5V)
- Breadboard and connecting wires
- PC with MPLAB IDE and a C Compiler (like XC8)

Task Description:

1. Setup the Hardware:
- Connect each digital input switch to a separate general-purpose input pin on the
PIC18F4550.
- Connect each relay to a separate general-purpose output pin. Ensure that the relays are
interfaced properly, considering the current requirements and voltage levels.

2. Initialize the I/O Ports:
- Configure the input pins connected to the switches as digital inputs.
- Configure the output pins connected to the relays as digital outputs.

3. Main Program Loop:
- Continuously check the state of each input switch.
- If Switch 1 is pressed (logic high), activate Relay 1.
- If Switch 2 is pressed (logic high), activate Relay 2.
- Ensure that the relay is deactivated when the corresponding switch is not pressed.

4. Debounce Mechanism (Optional but recommended):
- Implement a simple software debouncing mechanism for the input switches to prevent
false triggering due to switch bounce.

5. Testing:
- Test the program by pressing and releasing each switch and observing the activation and
deactivation of the corresponding relay.
- Verify that the relays do not activate when the switches are not pressed.

6. Documentation:
- Document the setup process, including a schematic of the circuit.
- Comment the source code for clarity and future reference.

Expected Learning Outcome:
- Understanding of basic I/O operations in embedded C for PIC microcontrollers.
- Practical experience in interfacing switches and relays with the PIC18F4550.
- Familiarity with software debouncing techniques.

Submission:
- Provide the complete source code of the program.
- Include a brief report detailing the implementation process, testing procedures, and any
challenges faced.
